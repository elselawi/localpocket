## Unreleased

- **BREAKING: `between` is now inclusive on both ends.**
  `where(field, between: (start, end))` compiles to `>= start AND <= end`
  (SQL `BETWEEN` semantics). Previously it was half-open `[start, end)`,
  silently dropping every record whose value equaled `end` — e.g. a
  date-range filter losing records stamped exactly at the range's upper
  bound. To keep the old behavior, replace
  `where(f, between: (a, b))` with `where(f, gte: a, lt: b)`. Pinned by the
  query-edge corpus, the predicate SQL golden, and the compiled-plan tests.
- `pruneOutbox` no longer evicts non-clean outbox ops under the `maxEntries`
  cap: evicting `error`/`inFlight`/`quarantine` ops silently deleted unsynced
  local edits and left dangling `op_id`s. Pruning is now strictly clean-only
  (settled or orphaned ops are removed; every pending op is retained).
  `maxEntries` is kept for API compatibility but is no longer enforced.
